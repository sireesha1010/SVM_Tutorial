# SVM Tutorial with Iris Dataset

This repository demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification using the Iris dataset. The implementation includes dataset preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with visualizations of decision boundaries.

## Files
- `svm_script.py`: Python script for SVM implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SVM_Tutorial.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SVM_Tutorial
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python svm_script.py
   ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Results
The SVM model achieves high accuracy on the Iris dataset and demonstrates the effect of kernel selection on classification boundaries.
